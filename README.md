# WebSocket

This is a mini messenger by WebSocket

miniLocalMessenger is developed by C# language.
In this program, it works as text data transfer and more methods will be added to it in future updates.

Using the [System.Net.WebSockets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.websockets.websocket?view=net-7.0), [System.Net](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net?view=net-7.0) classes this project has progressed, but it can only send and receive text data, which we will face in the future when file transfer is added. This program is without any special UI, only the focus is on the codes and coding process.
